The CPU is a 16-bit processor in all respects. 16-bit addresses are split into a 6-bit page
number and 10-bit page offset.

The CPU will have 16 general purpose registers. It will only support integer mathematical
operations.

The CPU will also have hardware interrupts. This will have an accompanying 8-bit code to
give more information on the device which triggered the interrupt.

There will also be a flags register that may be updated depending on certain instructions.

On startup, the processor executes from address 0x0000 and has interrupts disabled. The
value of the registers R0-R15 on startup are undefined. To enable interrupts  again, you
will need to invoke RETI.
