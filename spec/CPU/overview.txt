The CPU is a 16-bit processor in all respects apart from the 32-bit address bus.These 32-bit
addresses are split into a 22-bit page number and 10-bit page offset. It uses 16-bit words.

The CPU will have 16 general purpose registers. It will only support integer mathematical
operations. It will have a form of pipelining. It will cache pages for instruction and data
(or expansion card) memory separately, despite only interacting with one main memory bus.

For simplicity in hardware design, it will be managed by instructions on the processor
(i.e. you must manually specify pages to come into and out of cache). In this scheme, there
will be a way to access pages without caching so that I/O expansion cards and such can be
used more easily.

The CPU will also have hardware interrupts. This will have an accompanying 4-bit code to
give more information on the device which triggered the interrupt.
