On startup, interrupts are disabled, the instruction vector page register is
set to 0x0000, the interrupt address register is set to 0x0000 and PC is set
to 0x0000. All banks for data are set to cached. The instruction vector page
is then imported and execution begins.

Note that execution starts from the instruction vector page cache, initialised
with page 0x0000, rather than any of the other banks. Effectively, startup is
performed as if an interrupt were called, with some default values set.
