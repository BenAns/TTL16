There are only hardware interrupts available.

Hardware interrupts are performed by pulling the hardware
interrupt line of the CPU high, giving an 8-bit code on
the hardware interrupt code lines for the nature of the
interrupt.

Interrupts of all form are disabled while handling an interrupt.
Interrupts are automatically enabled again after invoking RETI.

The address to return from an interrupt to is stored in the
interrupt address register, which is automatically used to
return from the interrupt when invoking RETI.

One interrupt vector is used to handle all interrupts. This
vector is stored in IV.
