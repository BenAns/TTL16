Memory will be cached and split into pages. The 32-bit memory bus is split into 22-bit pages and 10-bit
offsets. The cache stores whole pages as instruction or data memory.

The instruction and data memory spaces will only have access to 64kB at a time. This means that 16 pages
at a time can be inserted into the instruction or data memory caches.

The cache will be manually managed using registers accessible to the programmer. There will be instructions
to "import" or "flush" memory for a particular page in cache. Each page in the data cache will also have
the ability to be a direct passthrough to the memory address.
