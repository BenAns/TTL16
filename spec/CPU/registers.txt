There are 16 general purpose registers, R0-R15, each 16 bits long.

There are 8 bank registers, B0-B7, each 16 bits long. B0-B3 are
the banks for instruction memory (lowest address to highest),
whereas B4-B7 are the banks for data memory (lowest address to
highest again). Where this, there is a bank use register, BU,
which stores whether any of the data banks are cached or direct
pass-through.

There is a flags register, FL, containing the following flags: zero
less, equal, greater and overflow. These are each single bit
values that may be determined by certain instructions.

There is a program counter, PC, which contains the address of the
instruction to execute. Specifically, fetching an instruction, the
value in IR is used. Immediately after this, it is incremented. This
register is modified in branching instructions.

There is an interrupt register, IR, which contains information on
interrupt caused. From LSB to MSB:
    Bits 0-7 - Interrupt code
    Bit 8    - 1 if hardware interrupt, 0 if software interrupt
