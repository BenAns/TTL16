There are 16 general purpose registers, R0-R15, each 16 bits long.
R15 is also used as the interrupt vector register, so also called IV.

There is a flags register, FL, containing the following flags: zero
less, equal, greater and overflow. These are each single bit
values that may be determined by certain instructions.

There is a program counter, PC, which contains the address of the
instruction to execute. Specifically, fetching an instruction, the
value in IR is used. Immediately after this, it is incremented. This
register is modified in branching instructions.

There is an interrupt register, IR, which contains information on
interrupt caused. From LSB to MSB:
    Bits 0-7 - Interrupt code

Each individual register is defined as so:
Inputs: One 16-bit word (DIN), one-bit write (W), one-bit read enable (RE)
Outputs: One three-state 16-bit word (DOUT)

When W is high, DIN is written to the register. The stored value stays
constant when W is low.

When RE is low, DOUT outputs the word stored in the register. When RE
is high, DOUT is unconnected.
