There are 16 general purpose registers, R0-R15, each 16 bits long.
R15 is also used as the interrupt vector register, so also called IV.

There is a flags register, FL, containing the following flags: zero
less, equal, greater and overflow. These are each single bit
values that may be determined by certain instructions.

There is a program counter, PC, which contains the address of the
instruction to execute. Specifically, fetching an instruction, the
value in IR is used. Immediately after this, it is incremented. This
register is modified in branching instructions.

There is an interrupt register, IR, which contains information on
interrupt caused. From LSB to MSB:
    Bits 0-7 - Interrupt code
