The ALU will be its own fully functional subsystem. All operations may be implemented
using it, though it may not directly support all operations.

Operations needed:
Addition
Subtration
Negation

Logical AND
Logical OR
Logical XOR
Complement

Left Shift
Arithetic/Logical Right Shift
Left Rotate
Right Rotate

Comparison (Signed/Unsigned)

All these operations can be performed in one clock cycle using combinational logic.

Inputs: Two 16-bit integers (A, B)
Outputs: One 16-bit integer (C), flags (overflow, less, equal, greater, zero)
