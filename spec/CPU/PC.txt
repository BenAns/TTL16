The PC is a register holding the value of an address to execute. Differently
from a normal register, we to be able to both increment it and read from data
input.

Such a PC can be defined as so:
Inputs:  16-bit data input (DIN),
         1-bit write line (W),
         1-bit write type (writeFromDIN)
Outputs: 16-bit data output (DOUT)

DOUT continually outputs the value held in the PC, just like a register.

While writeFromDIN is held high, the other lines act just as a normal
register.

While writeFromDIN is held low, pulling W high writes DOUT + 1 to the PC. This
occurs on the positive clock edge of W. DIN has no effect on the PC while
writeFromDIN is held low.
