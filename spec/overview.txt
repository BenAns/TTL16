At a high level, this computer is to be structured of the CPU, (primary) memory and expansion cards. The
expansion cards add all I/O functionality, extra computer power beyond the CPU or extra (secondary) memory
beyond the primary memory.

From the view of the CPU, the expansion cards are memory-mapped devices. For this, the computer will have
a 16-bit data bus and a 16-bit address bus, split into 6-bit pages and 10-bit offsets in each of the pages.
Any expansion card will have pages allocated based on the socket it is plugged into, which only it can
communicate to the CPU with. Primary memory will provide some number of pages of memory to the CPU, but
not be able to interfere with the pages allocated to expansion cards. This primary memory will provide whole
16-bit words for each address.

The expansion cards can also cause hardware interrupts on the CPU. Depending on the slot of the expansion card,
a 8-bit code is given to the CPU for the interrupt.
